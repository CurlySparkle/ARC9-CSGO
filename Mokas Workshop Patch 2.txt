A rather large update that changes the recoil, fixes problems, rebalances a ton of attachments and so much more is available.
Here's an abbrevriated version:
[b][u][/u][/b]
[table][tr]
	[th][list]
	[*]All weapons has had their accuracy and spread adjusted
	[*]All weapons now have altered camouflage coverage*
	[*]Tons of adjustments to attachments and weapons
	[*]Integration with Escape from Tarkov attachments
	[*]Русский язык (Russian language)
	
	And quite a bit more.
	[/list][/th]
[/tr][/table]

[i]*Does not include:
[list]
[*]SCAR-17
[*]MP5
[*]Scout
[*]Shield
[*]All 'extra' weapons excluding the Zeus x27
[/list][/i]

And here's the long, more detailed version:

[b][u]Integration with Escape from Tarkov attachments[/u][/b]
All weapons can now equip so-called Integration attachments that allows you to equip scopes, muzzles, grips, GLs, stocks and laser sights from the [i][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2952911209]Escape from Tarkov packs[/url][/i].

[i]Note[/i]: These attachments are not made for GSR and can therefore cause visual glitches to occur. They will not be a priority to fix unless absolutely hideous.
Additionally, the [b]Ergonomics[/b] stat does nothing to the GSR weapons.

[b][u]Weapon changes[/u][/b]
All weapons have gotten spread and recoil adjustments. This applies to [b]ALL[/b] firearms in the pack (not counting grenades, melees, etc.) and will not be listed below. Long story short, this will mean that all weapons are much more accurate than before.

All weapons will have the following things added and adjusted:
[list]
[*]Added visual recoil, especially when hip-firing
[*]Adjusted recoil patterns and values
[*]Adjusted accuracy and spread values
[/list]

Weapons not listed below did not have any additional changes.
