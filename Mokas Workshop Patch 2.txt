A rather large update that changes the recoil, fixes problems, rebalances a ton of attachments and so much more is available.
Here's an abbrevriated version:
[b][u][/u][/b]
[table][tr]
	[th][list]
	[*]All weapons now use visual recoil
	[*]All weapons now have altered camouflage coverage*
	[*]Adjusted a few attachment stats
	[*]Integration with Escape from Tarkov attachments
	[*]Русский язык (Russian language)
	
	And quite a bit more.
	[/list][/th]
[/tr][/table]

[i]*Does not include:
[list]
[*]SCAR-17
[*]MP5
[*]Scout
[*]Shield
[*]All 'extra' weapons
[/list][/i]

And here's the long, more detailed version:

[b][u]Integration with Escape from Tarkov attachments[/u][/b]
All weapons can now equip so-called Integration attachments that allows you to equip scopes, muzzles, grips, GLs, stocks and laser sights from the [i][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2952911209]Escape from Tarkov packs[/url][/i].

[i]Note[/i]: These attachments are not made for GSR and can therefore cause visual glitches to occur. They will not be a priority to fix unless absolutely hideous.
Additionally, the [b]Ergonomics[/b] stat does nothing to the GSR weapons.

[b][u]Weapon changes[/u][/b]
All weapons have gotten visual recoil added to them. This applies to [i]all[/i] weapons. This will not be repeated for the list below.

All weapons have gotten spread and recoil adjustments. This applies to [b]ALL[/b] firearms in the pack (not counting grenades, melees, etc.) and will not be listed below.

This means that all weapons will have the following things added and adjusted:
[list]
[*]Added visual recoil, especially when hip-firing
[*]Adjusted recoil patterns and values
[*]Adjusted accuracy and spread values
[/list]

Weapons not listed below did not have any additional changes.
