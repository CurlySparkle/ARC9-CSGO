[Comments]
> Dual weapons in general
	- When it comes to the dual wielded weapons, I believe that they should have either a small or large boost in rate of fire, depending on the weapon.
	- Additionally, I also believe that they shouldn't get a very big recoil reduction when "aiming". Sure, it should be noticable, but not heavily - you don't exactly have a stock or a good grip on the guns, after all.

> Dual Deagles
	- The damage was lowered due to the increase in rate of fire. Can still 1-shot at 84m ranges, so not too big of a deal.

> Dual Glock-18
	- The damage was lowered to be on-par with the non-dual wielded Glock-18.

> Dual P250
	- While sure, custom firing modes that is either semi-auto or a glorified 2-round burst is cool, it serves no purpose what so ever. Could also just be old code.

> Dual Sawed-Offs & Sawed-Off
	- I lowered the viewmodel kick due to it being rather insane. Sure, it's a sawed-off shotgun, but come the fuck on.

> G3SG1 Attachments
	- I believe that a ton of attachments can use rebalancing, but seeing that a shorter barrel on the G3SG1 increased range just made me say "Fuck it, I'll start here". So I rebalanced all of its barrel and stock attachments. Might move on with the magazines later on, who knows.
