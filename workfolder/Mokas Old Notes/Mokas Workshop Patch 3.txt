A smaller quality of life improvement update is now available.

Here's an abbrevriated version:
[b][u][/u][/b]
[table][tr]
	[th][list]
	[*]All weapons now have improved spread and recoil values
	[*]Added new barrels to the Scout
	[*]Added 6 new perks from GSO
	[/list][/th]
[/tr][/table]

And here's the longer, more detailed version:

[b][u]Weapon changes[/u][/b]
All weapons now use a "Recoil per Shot" and "Recoil Max" value that adjusts weapon spread every shot and maximum amount of "Recoil" a gun can have at one time. Additionally, all guns have much shorter recoil depreciation values, meaning they go back to neutral more naturally after firing.

This applies to [b]ALL*[/b] guns, including rifles, SMGs, LMGs, shotguns and snipers.

[i]*Does not however apply to the AWP, Scout or SSG 08[/i]
